# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
## Project Overview
With the initial module 7 analysis completed, a secondary analysis of retirement eligible employees was requested to determine future hiring needs.  Employees deemed coming up for retirement by age and length of employment were grouped by title and department for manager awareness.  A second report was pulled for employees born in 1965 seeking to establish a pool of employees that would be considered for a mentorship program.
## Analysis Results
* Retiring Employees by Title
  * There are 72,458 current employees up for retirement

## Summary
The company's hiring needs are substantial as these groups approach retirement age and there is an inherent risk involved in losing a large amount of Senior Level Staff and Engineers.  The small pool of employees eligible for mentorship could be expanded beyond those born in 1965, but an alternate consideration may be to begin elevating existing staff to senior level.
